## UX

## Design

## Features
The main feature of this web app is the ability to answer a series questions where upon conclusion users can submit their score or restart the application to re answer the list of questions.


## Features Left to Implement

Future features I would like to implement are firstly connecting the web application to a relational database.  I would then incorporate a user registration and login page. Each user account would have the ability to set the amount of questions to answer also set difficulty levels of the questions. Users would be able to add questions and answers to existing lists of questions and also create their own list of questions. 


## User Requirements

* As a user I want to be able to answer questions 
* As a user I want to be able to confirm my answers are correct
* As a user I want to be able to submit my score if I wish to
* As a user I want to be able to restart the list of questions
