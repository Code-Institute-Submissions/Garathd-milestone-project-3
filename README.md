## Features Left to Implement

Future features I would like to implement are firstly connecting the web application to a relational database.  I would then incorporate a user registration and login page. Each user account would have the ability to set the amount of questions to answer also set difficulty levels of the questions. Users would be able to add questions and answers to existing lists of questions and also create their own list of questions. 

## User Requirements
* As a user I want to be able to answer questions 
* As a user I want to be able to confirm my answers are correct
